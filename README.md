# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis was to provide a report to a client who is looking to get into the cryptocurrency market. The report will show which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investor. I gathered the data from CryptoCompare, preprocessed the data for unsupervised machine learning, performed PCA Analysis, predicted clusters and plotted my results.
